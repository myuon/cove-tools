# minicloud: design notes

How the host works and why, for a reader changing it. The
[README](../README.md) is how to use it; [testing.md](testing.md) is what the
tests hold it to, and [measurements.md](measurements.md) the numbers behind
the choices here.

## How requests are scheduled

```

- **The HTTP front is hyper 1.x on tokio.** It owns the protocol —
  keep-alive, pipelining, chunked bodies, header size and read timeouts — and
  the sockets, so an idle connection costs a task and no thread, and waiting
  on thousands of them is epoll/kqueue rather than the edge sample's `poll(2)`
  over every socket (cove#590). It is the established choice for a Rust HTTP
  server, and it is a library rather than a framework: routing, limits and
  the stats are this crate's, a few hundred lines.
- **No Cove code runs on tokio's threads.** A request is admitted into its
  app's queue and the connection's task awaits a oneshot. A dedicated pool of
  worker threads (`--workers`) takes jobs and, for each request, builds a
  fresh `OwnedVm` over the app's shared `PreparedProgram` (a few
  microseconds; nothing of one request is visible to the next).
- **A run that waits holds no worker.** A host call that answers pending
  (`timer.sleep`, a `fetch`) hands the scheduler a future; the run becomes a `ParkedVm`
  and the future runs on tokio, raced against the run's deadline. Its answer
  puts a resume job on the app's queue for whichever worker is free; a
  deadline that comes first cancels the run (504) and drops the future, which
  is how a pending `fetch` is withdrawn.
- **A long run is sliced.** Each worker publishes the run it is running; a
  monitor raises the run's `YieldRequest` once it has held its worker for a
  slice (`--slice`, 2 ms) *and* something is waiting for a worker. The run
  gives its worker up at its next safepoint — inside compiled code too (Cove
  ADR 0084, 0085) — and goes to the back of its app's queue as a
  `YieldedVm`, which any worker continues.
- **Apps are served round robin.** Each app has its own queue: runs to resume
  or continue, and requests waiting to start. A worker takes one job from the
  next app in turn that has work it may run; within an app, turns alternate
  between its started runs and its new requests, so a long run of an app
  does not hold back that app's own new requests either. A job is at most one slice of a run while others
  wait, so an app with hundreds of requests queued gets one turn in N like
  every other busy app: its backlog costs itself, not its neighbours. An app
  at `max_in_flight` has its starts held back (its started runs still
  continue); at `max_queued` new requests are rejected.

Turns are equal, not CPU: a turn that answers in 50 µs and one that runs its
full slice count the same. That is enough to stop starvation, which is what
this base needs; weighting turns by worker time (deficit round robin over
`worker_ms`) fits the same queues if measurements show it is wanted.

## Runtime constraints, made explicit

What the runtime cannot do yet is handled by refusing it or by counting it,
never by trusting it:

- **`spawn` is refused at load.** A spawned task is a thread outside the
  worker pool and its accounting; while one is alive its parent can neither
  park nor yield (ADR 0080 §2, 0084 §3), and it has no native tier (ADR
  0085). An app whose entry the checker says can reach a task `scope`
  (`FnEntry::can_spawn`, ADR 0088) is refused before it is prepared, with a
  diagnostic at the `spawn` (`minicloud::spawn`; the README's
  [Checking and testing an app](../README.md#checking-and-testing-an-app) shows one) — or at the entry
  when there is none to point at. That fact is a lower bound for a
  capability-open entry, so such an entry in a package where some function
  opens a scope is decided by its lowered program instead. Every run also
  carries `max_tasks = 0` as the runtime's backstop.
- **A run that cannot yield is surfaced.** Below an encoded function that
  compiled code called, inside a host call, or beside a task, a run declines a
  yield request and keeps its worker (ADR 0085's open items). The monitor
  counts a run still holding its worker well after it was asked (four slices,
  at least 20 ms) as `overdue_yields` and logs it; the runtime's own
  `yields_declined` is summed per app; and the run's **deadline still ends
  it**, since the deadline is checked at every safepoint whether or not the
  run can yield. `/_host/apps/<app>`'s `native.refusals` names the functions
  left on the encoded tier, with the instruction and the source line: a
  function that makes a host call, or writes a lambda, is one — and an
  algorithm called from such a function, by compiled code, cannot yield at
  all. The algorithm playground met exactly that ([its README](../examples/algo/README.md#yields-on-the-native-tier)).
- **A host call that cannot park blocks, and is counted.** In the same
  places a call cannot park; `timer.sleep` then sleeps on the worker
  (`blocking_host_calls`), bounded by its 60 s maximum. None of the small
  examples reaches this.
- **`max_heap_words` is the run's heap capacity.** Each isolate is built
  with `OwnedVm::with_heap_words` (ADR 0088), so a run that needs more fails
  the allocation where it makes it ("this run has no memory left", 500,
  `errors.heap`) rather than after it answers. Without it a run gets the
  runtime's default, 4 Mi words (32 MiB). It bounds Cove's heap, not what a
  host module holds outside it; above `u32::MAX` words, the most the runtime
  addresses, it is refused. A run's heap and declined yields are read at its
  every park and yield as well as its answer (`heap_peak_words`,
  `yields_declined`).
- **The native tier is used where it exists.** `--backend auto` compiles each
  app with `PreparedProgram::with_native` once at load on Unix x86-64 and
  says once, on stderr, that it falls back to the encoded VM elsewhere;
  `--backend vm` forces the VM, `--backend native` refuses apps where there is
  no native tier. `tier` in the stats says which each app got.
- **A client that disconnects cancels its run.** hyper drops the request's
  future when the connection closes, and a guard on it raises the request's
  cancellation: the runtime's `Cancellation` in the run's budget stops a
  running run at its next safepoint and a yielded one when it is continued;
  `Cancellation::on_cancel`, registered on the flag the parked run's meter
  hands back, wakes a parked run's wait, which cancels the run and drops its
  pending work (a fetch's connection with it); a request still queued is
  dropped when a worker reaches it. A run that cannot yield stops at its next
  safepoint all the same, since cancellation is checked there.

## Updates and versions

`minicloud update <app>` asks the running host to load `<apps>/<app>` again.
The new version is parsed, checked, admitted (capabilities, `spawn`, config),
lowered, prepared and compiled on a blocking thread — not on a worker, not on
the I/O runtime — while the current version keeps serving. **Only if all of
that succeeds** is the app's route switched, in one step; otherwise the
current version stays and the command prints the diagnostics and exits 1
(`updates_refused` in the stats, a line in the app's log).

- **Requests in flight finish on the version they were admitted to** —
  queued, running, yielded or parked: a request holds its version (and so
  its prepared program and registry) until it answers. Requests admitted
  after the switch get the new one.
- **The old version is dropped when its last request ends.** Its
  `PreparedProgram` goes with it; `/_host/apps/<app>` lists each version with
  `alive` and `program_alive`, and `versions_alive` / `programs_alive` count
  them.
- **Every response says which version answered**: `x-cove-app-version:
  v<n>-<hash>`, the hash being of the app's files, so two loads of the same
  code have the same hash. The id is in the stats, the logs and every
  recent error too.
- The app's counters, log, queue and KV store belong to the app, not the
  version: they carry over. During an update both versions share the one
  store (and its quota accounting); the new version's quotas apply from the
  switch.
- A name the host does not serve yet is **added** by `update`; `minicloud
  remove <app>` stops routing to an app (in-flight requests finish; its data
  stays, and `update` brings it back as its next version).
- One update runs at a time.

**The admin listener.** Updates go to a second listener, `--admin`
(default `127.0.0.1:8081`), never to the public one, so a reverse proxy that
forwards the public port cannot reach them, and the admin port can stay on
localhost whatever the public one is. Every admin request needs
`Authorization: Bearer <token>`; the host writes a random 256-bit token to
`<data>/admin.token` (mode 0600) the first time it starts without one, and
`minicloud update` / `remove` read it from there (`--token-file`, `--admin`
to point them elsewhere). Anything without the token is 401 and changes
nothing. The endpoints are `POST /apps/<app>/update`,
`POST /apps/<app>/deploy` and `/rollback` (see [Deploys](#deploys)), `DELETE /apps/<app>`,
`POST /apps/<app>/enable`, `/disable` and `/reset` (see [Administering apps
at run time](#administering-apps-at-run-time)), `GET /secrets`,
`PUT /secrets/<name>` and `DELETE /secrets/<name>` (see [Secrets set at run
time](#secrets-set-at-run-time)), `GET /apps` (the stats) and
`GET /changes?n=50` (the change history). There is no file watcher: an update is an
explicit act, which is what makes a refused one a report rather than a
silent non-event.

## Deploys

`minicloud deploy` packs an app and sends it to the admin listener, which
loads it and only then writes it into the apps directory and updates to it.

- **What is sent** is the app's `app.toml` and its `.cove` files, at any
  depth — nothing else (a README, samples, a `.git`; anything hidden is
  skipped). A symbolic link, a path outside the directory, and more than
  16 MiB or 4096 files are refused before anything is sent, and again by
  the host. The name is the directory's (`--name` to choose another); it is
  the app's route and its main module's name, so `aidaily/aidaily.cove`.
- **The check is the running host's**: the app is loaded as its next
  version with the host's env (its `[secrets]`, `[access]`), the admin's
  changes to its grant, and the hostnames other apps claim — exactly as an
  update loads it. **If it does not load, nothing changes**: no file is
  written, the current version keeps serving, and the diagnostics are
  printed (exit 1). An app that needs a secret the host does not have is
  refused here, saying which: set it first — in the admin app's Secrets
  page or with `minicloud secret set` for a `{ store = ... }` secret
  ([Secrets set at run time](#secrets-set-at-run-time)), or in
  `~/cove-tools/env` and a restart for an `{ env = ... }` one. A `[secrets]`
  value `{ file = ... }` is not sent: keep secrets in the store or the env.
- **If it loads**, it is written to `<apps>/.deploy/<app>`, the current
  `<apps>/<app>` is moved to `<apps>/.previous/<app>` (replacing the one kept
  there), the new copy is renamed into place, and the host updates to it:
  requests in flight finish on the old version, as with `update`.
- `minicloud rollback <app>` swaps `<apps>/<app>` with the kept copy — after
  loading it, so a kept version that no longer checks is refused and nothing
  moves — and updates to it. A second rollback undoes the first.
- Both are admin requests (`POST /apps/<app>/deploy` with the archive as the
  body, `POST /apps/<app>/rollback`), behind the same token as `update`, and
  both go in the change history.

`deploy -` reads a tar archive (any `tar`'s, macOS's included: its `._`
files are hidden and skipped) and needs `--name`. With a tunnel
(`ssh -L 8791:127.0.0.1:8791 whisky`) and a copy of the token,
`minicloud deploy apps/aidaily --admin 127.0.0.1:8791 --token-file <copy>`
works from the laptop too.

`minicloud deploy <dir> --into <apps>` does the same with no running host,
checking as `minicloud check` does with the current environment (and, with
`--data <data>`, that data directory's secret store); the host loads it at
its next start. `deploy/install.sh` installs the bundled admin app this way, and
checks every installed app with `--data` before it switches.

## Administering apps at run time

Beyond updating code, an app's **configuration** can be changed on the
running host — enabled or disabled, its grant, its fetch allowlist, its
limits — by one app, the admin app (`apps/admin`, issue #17), through a host
module of its own, and on the machine through the admin listener. No other
app can: the capability is `admin`, and **only the app named `admin` may be
granted it**. An `app.toml` of any other app that grants it — or a change
that would — refuses that app at load, and `minicloud check` says so. The
grant is a line in the startup banner and in `/_host/stats` like every other
(`admin  requires [admin, auth, …]  granted [admin, auth, …]`): the one app
that can change the others is visible as such.

The module is `host` (the admin app's own main module is `admin`, and Cove
refuses a package module that shadows a host module):

| operation | answers |
| --- | --- |
| `host.apps()` | `Array<host.App>`: every app — `state` (`serving`, `disabled`, `refused`, `removed`) and `reason`, `version`, `tier`, `entry`, `hosts`, `required` and `granted` (and `grantAdded`/`grantRemoved`, what the admin changed), `fetchAllow`, `limits` (`host.Limits`: `maxHostCalls`, `deadlineMs`, `maxHeapWords`, `maxInFlight`, `maxQueued`, `maxRequestBytes`, `maxResponseBytes`) and `limitsChanged`, `isAdmin`, its counters (`served`, `ok`, `errors`, `rejected`, `inFlight`, `queued`, `kvKeys`, `kvBytes`) and its ten newest `recentErrors` |
| `host.capabilities()` | `Array<String>`: what a grant may name |
| `host.history(limit)` | `Array<host.Change>`: `atMs`, `who`, `app`, `action`, `detail`, `outcome`, newest first |
| `host.setEnabled(app, enabled, who)` | `Result<String, Error>` |
| `host.configure(app, settings, who)` | `Result<String, Error>`: `settings` is `host.Settings { grant, fetchAllow, limits }`, the whole of what they are to be |
| `host.reset(app, who)` | `Result<String, Error>`: back to `app.toml` |
| `host.secrets()` | `Array<host.Secret>`: every secret stored or used — `name`, `set`, `updatedMs` (0 when unset), `apps` that use it — never a value |
| `host.setSecret(name, value, who)` | `Result<String, Error>`: stores it and reloads the apps that use it; the message is what each reload came to |
| `host.deleteSecret(name, force, who)` | `Result<String, Error>`: refused while an app uses it unless `force` |
| `host.kv(app, prefix, after, limit)` | `Array<host.KvEntry>`: a page of another app's store — `key`, `value` cut to 512 characters, `bytes` (the whole value's), `cut` — ascending, at most 500 |
| `host.kvValue(app, key)` | `Result<host.KvEntry, Error>`: one key, its value whole up to 64 KiB; `Err` when the store has no such key |
| `host.logs(app, limit)` | `Array<host.LogLine>`: the last `limit` lines of the app's ring — `atMs`, `level`, `text` — oldest first |

The five that change something park the run while the host works (an app
is reloaded on a blocking thread, as an update is), so they hold no worker.

**A change is a re-check, not a revocation.** Cove decides capabilities
before a program runs, so there is nothing to take away from a run in
progress: a change loads the app again with the change applied — parsed,
checked, admitted, lowered, prepared, compiled — and routes to that version
the way `minicloud update` does. Requests already admitted finish on the
version they were admitted to.

### Reading another app's store and log

The three reads above are how the admin app shows what an app holds and
what it said, and they are **reads only**: there is no operation that
writes to another app's store, so the one app granted `admin` cannot change
another app's data, only its configuration.

- **The store** is read from `<data>/<app>/kv.sqlite3` without opening it as
  the app does. A store a running version has open is read through that
  `Store`, so the page sees what the app has just written; one no version
  has open is opened read-only, and only if the file is there — the admin
  app looking at an app that has never written must not be what creates its
  store. The value is cut in SQL (`substr`), not after reading: a page of
  500 keys of up to 1 MiB each would otherwise be half a gigabyte to throw
  away. `bytes` is the whole value's length, the same measure the quota
  uses, so a cut value still says how large it is.
- **The log** is the ring of [Logs](#logs) — in memory, the last 1,000 lines,
  emptied by a restart — parsed back into `atMs`, `level` and `text` by the
  module that writes it. The file beside it (`<data>/<app>/log.txt`) is not
  read: a page that tails a rotating file is a different thing, and the ring
  is what a browser wants.
- **The app is named, not the path.** Both take an app's name and resolve it
  through the host's slots; a name the host does not serve answers empty
  rather than reaching into the data directory, so `..` in a name reads
  nothing.

| the reload | the change | the app |
| --- | --- | --- |
| loads | kept | serves the new version |
| is refused because its entry requires a capability the change took away | kept | **refused**: answers 503 with the reason; every other app serves |
| anything else: a limit out of range (deadline or in-flight below 1, a negative number, a heap above the runtime's), an allowlist entry that does not parse, a capability the host does not have, `admin` for another app | **not kept** | as before; the answer is the reason |

Taking a capability away from an app that needs it is how an app is stopped
from using it, so that is applied; a change that is merely wrong is not.
Granting it back loads the app again, with its store as it was.

**Disabling** stops routing to an app and nothing else: its version stays
loaded, and its queue, counters, log and store stay. A request to it is
answered **503** `app … is disabled by the administrator` (no `Retry-After`;
counted as `rejected.disabled`) — 503 rather than 404 so that an app that is
switched off is not mistaken for a mistyped URL; what was already admitted
finishes. Enabling routes to it again.

**The admin app cannot disable itself, take `admin` away from itself, or
make any change that would leave it refused** — those are refused, through
it. The admin listener can do all three, which is the point of it:

```console
$ ./target/checked/minicloud disable notes    # or enable, reset
`notes` disabled: not routed to; in-flight requests finish
$ ./target/checked/minicloud reset admin      # drop the admin's changes to the admin app
```

**Where the changes are kept.** Not in `app.toml`: a deploy replaces an
app's directory with what was sent (`install.sh --with-bundled-apps` too).
They are kept in the data directory, which no release and no deploy
touches:

- `<data>/_host/overrides.json`: per app, `enabled`, the capabilities and
  allowlist entries added and removed, and the limits set — each relative to
  `app.toml`, so a later release whose `app.toml` grants something new still
  grants it unless that very capability was removed. A change back to what
  the file says leaves no entry. It is applied every time the app loads (at
  start, on `update`, on a change), so it survives a restart and a release.
  It is plain JSON and the last way out: delete an app's entry, or the file,
  and restart. A file that does not read stops the host from starting —
  running without it would quietly re-enable and re-grant. A `limits.fuel`
  written by a host from before Cove ADR 0091 is dropped when the file is
  read, with a warning naming the app (see
  [Migrating from fuel](../README.md#migrating-from-fuel-cove-adr-0091)).
- `<data>/_host/changes.jsonl`: the history — who (what the admin app says
  of its user, or `admin listener`), when, which app, what was asked and
  what came of it, refused attempts included — one JSON line each, appended.
- `<data>/_host/secrets`: the secret store, below.

## Secrets set at run time

An API key used to mean ssh, an edit of `~/cove-tools/env` and a restart.
A secret can instead live in the host's **secret store** and be set,
replaced and deleted on the running host — from the admin app's Secrets
page, the admin listener, or `minicloud secret`. An `app.toml` takes a
secret from it with `store`, beside `env`, `file` and `value`:

```toml
[secrets]
gemini = { store = "gemini" }

[fetch]
allow = ["https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com"]

[fetch.headers."https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com"]
x-goog-api-key = { secret = "gemini" }
```

- **Where it is kept**: `<data>/_host/secrets`, one JSON file (`{ "secrets":
  { "<name>": { "value", "updated_ms" } } }`), mode 0600, written whole
  through a temporary file that is synced and renamed (and the directory
  synced), so a crash leaves the old file or the new one. The data directory
  is the one thing the service may write besides the apps
  (`ReadWritePaths`), and no release or deploy touches it. A file that does
  not read stops the host from starting, saying so without quoting it.
- **A secret that is not set refuses the app** that takes it, at load, with
  the usual diagnostic naming it — `secret `gemini`: the host's secret
  store has no `gemini` (set it on the admin app's Secrets page, or with
  `minicloud secret set gemini`)` — which is the reason the admin app shows
  for the app, and the Secrets page lists the name as unset and used by it.
  A name is a letter or digit, then letters, digits, `_`, `-` or `.`, at
  most 64; a value is not empty and at most 16 KiB.
- **Setting or replacing one reloads every app that uses it** — those
  routed to whose `app.toml` names it in a `store` — through the same
  versioned update as `minicloud update`: requests in flight finish on the
  old value, the new version has the new one. The answer says what each
  reload came to. **The value is stored first and kept whatever the reloads
  do**: an app that does not load (its code broken on disk, say) keeps
  serving what it served, and picks the value up at its next load.
- **Deleting one an app uses is refused** (409) unless forced; forced, the
  apps that use it are reloaded without it and are refused (503), so the
  value is no longer used anywhere.
- **Write-only.** No endpoint, page or command returns a value: the listings
  are names, whether each is set, when, and which apps use it. Nothing
  logs one, and the stats, the diagnostics and the change history (which
  records who, the secret's name and the action — app `–`) do not hold
  one. The admin app handles the value once, in the request that sets it,
  in a password field that is never filled back in.

| through | list | set or replace | delete |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| the admin app (`/secrets`) | the table | the row's password field, or *Set a secret* | the row's *Delete*, with *confirm* ticked (and *force* for one in use) |
| the admin listener | `GET /secrets` | `PUT /secrets/<name>`, the value as the body | `DELETE /secrets/<name>[?force=1]` |
| `minicloud secret` | `list` | `set <name>`, the value on stdin | `delete <name> [--force]` |

The admin app's forms are POSTs under its usual protections: an identity
(`auth.identity`: Cloudflare Access, or its token where Access is off), and
a POST from another site refused (`Sec-Fetch-Site`, `Origin`). There is no
script on its pages, so the confirmation is a required checkbox, checked
again by the app. `minicloud secret` takes `deploy`'s `--admin` and
`--token-file`; `set` reads one line without echo from a terminal, or all of
stdin otherwise, dropping one trailing newline:

```console
$ ssh whisky '~/cove-tools/current/minicloud secret list --admin 127.0.0.1:8791 --token-file ~/cove-tools/data/admin.token'
$ ssh -t whisky '~/cove-tools/current/minicloud secret set gemini --admin 127.0.0.1:8791 --token-file ~/cove-tools/data/admin.token'
value for secret `gemini` (not echoed):
```

## Routing by hostname

An app may be reached by a hostname of its own instead of by its prefix:

```toml
[route]
hosts = ["covtools-admin.ramda.io", "admin.localhost"]
```

A request whose `Host` (without its port) is one of them reaches the app with
its whole path — `/`, `/apps/notes`, even `/_host/...` — and the app is **not**
reachable as `/<app>/` on any other hostname: `https://covtools.ramda.io/admin/`
is a 404. That is what lets a hostname carry an access policy of its own
(Cloudflare Access, in the deployment) without another hostname's policy
being a way round it. A hostname reaches one app; a second app claiming it
is refused. `x-forwarded-prefix` is empty for such an app.

**Each routed hostname is its own origin.** Under `--public-origin
https://covtools.ramda.io`, a request routed by `covtools-admin.ramda.io` is
told `x-forwarded-proto: https` and `host: covtools-admin.ramda.io` (the
public origin's scheme, and its port if it has one) — the name the route
matched, never one the client chose — so an app's same-origin check compares
against the origin its own pages were served from.

## `kv`: the app's persistent store

Each app has its own store, `<data>/<app>/kv.sqlite3`, opened only for an app
granted `kv`. One database per app is the namespace: an app's `kv` holds its
own connection and nothing else, so no key it can write reaches another
app's data.

- `list(prefix, after, limit)` answers the entries (`kv.Entry { key, value
  }`) whose key starts with `prefix` and is greater than `after` (`""` for the
  first page), ascending, at most `limit` (1–1000); `listDesc(prefix, before,
  limit)` the same descending, keys less than `before`. The last key of a page
  is where the next one starts, so an app that writes `event:<zero-padded
  time>` lists its newest events with `kv.listDesc("event:", "", 50)` — the
  shape the webhook lab's history (#2) and the benchmark ledger's runs by
  prefix (#3) need.
- A `put` past a quota is the app's `Err`, naming the quota, and the store is
  unchanged: `max_key_bytes`, `max_value_bytes`, `max_keys`, `max_bytes` (keys
  and values summed) under `[kv]`.

**Why SQLite**: it is the boring choice — one file per app, a format that
outlives this program, crash-safe by design — and `rusqlite`'s `bundled`
feature builds it in, with no system library. It runs in WAL mode with
`synchronous = NORMAL`: a committed write survives the host process
crashing; a power loss may lose the last transactions, never the file.

**Every call answers at once, on the worker**, never on the async runtime's
threads: a call into a local SQLite is cheaper than parking, and a worker
held for a `put` is far inside a 2 ms slice
([measurements.md](measurements.md#the-cost-of-a-kv-call-against-a-park)).

## `fetch`: outbound HTTP to an allowlist

`[fetch] allow` in `app.toml` lists where the app may call:
`scheme://host` (the scheme's port), `scheme://host:port`, or
`scheme://host:*` (any port), `http` or `https`. The `fetch` capability says
an app may call out at all; the allowlist says where, and the host holds
every call to it at the boundary:

- a URL off the list is answered `Err` **at once, before anything is
  sent**, without parking (counted in `fetch.refused`);
- redirects are not followed — a 3xx is answered as the response it is — so
  an allowed host cannot send the request elsewhere;
- hosts match by name as written; what a name resolves to is the system
  resolver's, so this is no defence against DNS rebinding.

**An API key the app never sees.** An app cannot read a secret (`auth.check`
only compares against one), so a key for an authenticated API is given to the
host instead, which adds it as a header when the request is sent:

```toml
[secrets]
openai = { env = "OPENAI_API_KEY" }
gemini = { env = "GEMINI_API_KEY" }

[fetch]
allow = ["https://api.openai.com", "https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com"]

[fetch.headers."https://api.openai.com"]
authorization = { secret = "openai", prefix = "Bearer " }

[fetch.headers."https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com"]
x-goog-api-key = { secret = "gemini" }
```

- Each `[fetch.headers."<origin>"]` key is a header name; its value names a
  `[secrets]` entry, with an optional literal `prefix` sent before it
  (empty by default).
- The app is refused at load, saying why and never quoting the value, if
  the origin is not a bare origin (`scheme://host[:port]`: no path, no
  `:*`), is not an entry of `[fetch] allow` (compared as parsed, so
  `https://api.openai.com` and `https://api.openai.com:443` are the same), if
  the secret is not in `[secrets]`, the header name is not one, or the prefix
  and secret cannot be a header value.
- The header is added to a request whose URL has **exactly that origin** —
  scheme, host and effective port — and to no other. It is added after the
  app's headers and **replaces** an app-supplied header of the same name
  (names compare case-insensitively).
- The value never reaches the app: not in a `fetch.Response`, an `Err`, a
  log line, the stats or the admin app's view of the app. Redirects are not
  followed, so a redirect cannot carry it to another origin.
- The admin app's allowlist changes cannot point it at a new origin: the
  origin is checked against `[fetch] allow` as `app.toml` writes it, and only
  `app.toml` can bind a header. Removing the origin from the allowlist at run
  time leaves the app loaded, and requests there are refused like any other
  off the list.

What the host does not do is defend the value against the app's own code:
apps share one process (see the README's [Security](../README.md#security)). This keeps the key out of
the app's hands as a string, in its logs and in its answers.

A fetch parks the run. It is a future on the I/O runtime (reqwest over
hyper) raced against the run's deadline and against the client going away;
whichever ends first drops the future, which closes the outbound
connection, so the upstream sees the request abandoned. Each fetch is also
bounded by `[fetch] timeout` (default 10 s), `max_request_bytes` (its body,
default 1 MiB) and `max_response_bytes` (default 4 MiB). Any response is
`Ok`, whatever its status; an `Err` is a fetch that got none.

**Compressed responses are decoded.** A request goes out with
`accept-encoding: gzip, deflate, br` unless the app set its own
`accept-encoding`, which is sent as written. A response with
`content-encoding: gzip`, `deflate` or `br` is decoded whatever the request
asked for — some servers compress regardless — and the app sees the decoded
body, without the `content-encoding` and `content-length` headers, which
describe the encoded one. Any other encoding is handed over as it came,
header included.

- `max_response_bytes` bounds the **decoded** body. Decoding streams and
  stops as soon as the limit is passed, so a compression bomb (a megabyte
  that inflates to a gigabyte) is the usual too-large `Err`, refused without
  being inflated.
- A body that does not decode — corrupt, truncated, or not in the encoding
  its header names — is an `Err` (`fetch could not decode the response: …`),
  never garbage text.

**https** is supported, with rustls and the Mozilla root set
(`webpki-roots`), so there is no dependency on the system's OpenSSL. Inbound
TLS stays the reverse proxy's job, but outbound calls have no proxy to do it
for them.

## Cloudflare Access: who is asking

An app behind [Cloudflare Access](../deploy/cloudflare.md) asks the host who
its user is with `auth.identity(request.headers)`, instead of a login of its
own (issue #23). Access adds the user's token — a JWT signed by the team's
keys — to every request it lets through, as `Cf-Access-Jwt-Assertion` (and
the `CF_Authorization` cookie, read when the header is missing). The host
verifies it: the RS256 signature by a key of the team's JWKS
(`https://<team>/cdn-cgi/access/certs`, chosen by `kid`), `iss` the team,
`aud` one of the app's `[access] aud`, `exp` and `nbf` with a minute's
leeway, an `email` claim (so an Access service token is not an identity),
and `[access] emails` if set. The answer is `Ok(auth.Identity { email, via:
"access" })`, or `Err` saying what was wrong.

The keys are fetched with the first token and kept; a token naming a key not
held fetches them again (Cloudflare rotates them), at most once a second, and
keys an hour old are refreshed when next needed. If the keys cannot be
fetched, every token they would verify is refused and the failure is logged:
it fails closed. A fetch parks the run; a token whose key is held is answered
at once.

`[access] token` names a `[secrets]` entry presented as `Authorization:
Bearer <secret>` or a Basic password (`via: "token"`, no email). With Access
off for the app — a local run, where `team` or `aud` is unset — it is the way
in, and `auth.usesAccess()` is `false`, so the app can answer 401 with a
login prompt. With Access on it is accepted only under `fallback = "token"`;
the admin app and the webhook lab say `"none"`, so a request that did not come through Access
— straight to `127.0.0.1:8790`, say — is refused whatever it presents, and
no browser prompt is shown (403). A script that needs in goes through Access
too, which takes an Access service token anyway, and a service token has no
email: the admin listener is the way for a script on the machine.

The apps only call `auth.identity`; nothing else of a request is affected,
so a path an app does not guard — the webhook lab's receive URLs — needs no
token and fetches no keys.

## What the deployment relies on from the host

- **`--ops-listener admin`**: `/_host/` is 404 on the public listener; the
  operations views are on the admin listener, which is never in the tunnel.
- **`[route] hosts` in the admin app's `app.toml`**: the admin UI is
  `https://covtools-admin.ramda.io`, a second public hostname on the same
  tunnel and port with an Access application of its own; it is not
  reachable under `covtools.ramda.io` ([Routing by hostname](#routing-by-hostname)).
  Its changes live in `data/_host/`, which a release does not touch. No flag
  and no unit change was needed for it.
- **Cloudflare Access, verified by the host** (`[access]` in the admin
  app's and the webhook lab's `app.toml`, the values in `~/cove-tools/env`):
  the admin UI and the webhook lab's admin pages know their user from the
  Access token, and refuse a request that did not come through Access
  ([Cloudflare Access](#cloudflare-access-who-is-asking),
  [deploy/cloudflare.md](../deploy/cloudflare.md) §6). No flag and no unit
  change: `EnvironmentFile=` already reads the env.
- **`--public-origin https://covtools.ramda.io`**: cloudflared reaches the
  host as plain HTTP on localhost, but the browser's `Origin` is the public
  one. The host tells every app `x-forwarded-proto: https` and
  `host: covtools.ramda.io`, so the webhook lab's and the ledger's
  cross-site refusals compare against the right origin and the receive URLs
  the lab shows are the public ones. Without it a client cannot claim
  `https` (the host sets `x-forwarded-proto: http` itself); `--trust-proxy`
  believes a proxy's `X-Forwarded-Proto` and `X-Forwarded-Host` instead, for
  a proxy that serves several names. Nothing in the host or the apps uses the
  client's address; cloudflared's `cf-connecting-ip` reaches the apps as a
  header (the webhook lab stores it with each request).
