# minicloud: what the tests hold it to

`cargo t` (an alias for `cargo test --workspace --profile checked`) runs the
whole suite; the [README](../README.md#development) has the full gate CI runs.

The tests run Cove programs, so they run optimised (`--profile checked`, as
in Cove's own repository); a bare `cargo test` works, more slowly. The
integration tests (`crates/minicloud/tests/host.rs`, `services.rs` and
`updates.rs`, `deploying.rs`, `admin.rs`, `access.rs`, `secrets.rs`, and one
per real example: `webhooks.rs`, `ledger.rs`, `algo.rs`) start the host
in-process on a free port and ask it over TCP. None asserts a duration: where
a test needs the host in some state it waits for the host's own stats to say
so, and what it asserts is counted.

- two or more apps answer concurrently;
- `hello` answers while `crunch` holds every worker and `slow` is parked,
  and the crunches yielded and the slow runs parked at every sleep without
  blocking a worker;
- an app past its `max_queued` gets 429 with `Retry-After` while another app
  answers; the server past `--max-in-flight` gets 503; past
  `--max-connections`, 503;
- deadline (while running and while parked) and host-call overruns end only
  that request;
- an over-reaching app and a spawning app are refused at load, the others
  serve, and `check` agrees;
- request (declared and chunked) and response size limits;
- with one app flooding its queue on a single worker, another app's five
  requests are all served while the flood still has requests queued;
- on x86-64 Unix, the apps run on the native tier and a compiled run still
  yields;
- two apps' stores are separate (and separate files); a store survives
  stopping the host and starting another over the same data directory;
  quotas answer the app's `Err`; listing pages both ways;
- `fetch` reaches an allowed local upstream with GET and with POST carrying
  a header and a body, exactly as the upstream records them; a target off
  the allowlist is refused with the upstream seeing no connection at all;
- a `[fetch.headers]` secret reaches its origin, with its prefix, replacing
  the app's header of the same name; another allowed origin gets the app's
  header and not the secret; and the value is in none of the app's answers,
  a failed fetch's `Err`, its logs, its admin view or the stats;
- a fetch is abandoned — the upstream sees its connection closed — at the
  run's deadline, and when the client goes away;
- a client going away cancels a spinning run that is running or yielded, one
  still queued (without running it), and a parked one, each counted;
- an update while requests are parked, running, yielded and queued: each of
  those answers with the old version's body and `x-cove-app-version`, a
  request after the switch with the new one's, and once they have drained
  the old version and its `PreparedProgram` are gone;
- an update refused for a parse error, an ungranted capability, a `spawn` or
  a config error keeps the current version serving, answers 422 with the
  reason, and another app answers throughout;
- the admin listener answers 401 without the token (missing, wrong, empty)
  and changes nothing, and the public listener has no update route;
- an update adds an app, `remove` removes one, and an update brings it back;
- deploying (`deploying.rs`, and `deploy.rs`'s unit tests): an archive is
  refused for a symbolic link, a path that leaves the directory (`..`, an
  absolute path), a hard link, a pipe, a duplicate or its size, and packs
  `app.toml` and `.cove` files only; a deploy adds an app, and replaces one
  while a request parked on the old version finishes on it; a deploy that
  does not parse, that needs an ungranted capability or that needs a secret
  the env lacks is refused with its reason and changes no file; rollback
  restores the kept version and a second undoes it; both need the token;
  `minicloud deploy` from a directory and from stdin, and `--into`;
  `deploy/smoke.sh` (CI, Linux) checks the release packages `admin` alone,
  `install.sh` deploys it by default and refuses an example asked for as a
  bundled app, pointing at `examples/`, leaves an app that is not the
  release's alone (the examples, deployed from `examples/`) and refuses to
  switch while one does not check;
- through the `host` module: the list shows every app's state, grant and
  limits; a disabled app answers 503 while one of its requests in flight
  finishes, and enabled again has its store; taking a needed capability
  away refuses that app alone, and granting it back restores it; eight kinds
  of wrong change are refused with their reasons and change nothing; `admin`
  granted to another app is refused at load and by `check`; the admin app
  cannot disable itself or drop `admin`, and the admin listener can; the
  changes survive a restart and a release that replaces `apps/`; the history
  records who, when and what; an app with a hostname is reached by it alone,
  as that hostname's origin, and a hostname reaches one app;
- the secret store (`secrets.rs`, and `secrets.rs`'s and `config.rs`'s unit
  tests): the file survives reopening, is mode 0600, leaves no temporary
  file, and a write that fails leaves the old file and value; names and
  values are held to their rules and a broken file is refused, none of it
  quoting a value; an app whose stored secret is missing is refused naming
  it; setting it reloads the app, and `auth.check` and a `[fetch.headers]`
  header sent to a test upstream use the new value, replacing it the old
  value no longer works, and a restart finds it; a reload that fails keeps
  the value stored and the serving version; deleting a secret an app uses is
  409 unless forced, and forced refuses the app; the admin app sets,
  replaces and deletes from its page (a cross-site POST refused, a delete
  needing *confirm*, and *force* when used); `minicloud secret set|list|delete`;
  `check --data` and `test` without the secret (on a placeholder, said); and
  the value is in none of the listener's answers, the admin pages, the stats,
  the operations views, the logs, the change history or `overrides.json`;
- the operations page escapes markup an app logs, and shows errors and KV
  usage against the quota; an app's log reaches `<data>/<app>/log.txt`;
- Cloudflare Access (`access.rs`, against a JWKS the test serves with RSA
  keys it generates): a valid token gets into the admin UI (header or
  cookie) and the history records its verified email, not the unverified
  `Cf-Access-Authenticated-User-Email`; no token, a malformed one, a forged
  signature, another application's `aud`, another team's `iss`, an expired
  one, one not valid yet, one with no `exp`, one with no email (a service
  token) and an email not allowed are each refused with 403 and no prompt,
  and change nothing; the admin secret alone is refused while Access is on;
  a token signed by a rotated-in key fetches the keys again and gets in, the
  keys are then held, and an unknown key is refused with its fetches rate
  limited; with the JWKS down every token is refused and the failure logged,
  and back up the next one gets in; `fallback = "token"` lets the secret in,
  recorded as `token`; with Access off the secret and its Basic prompt are
  as before; the webhook lab's pages need the lab's own application's token
  while its receive URLs need nothing and fetch no keys.

`COVE_HOST_TEST_BACKEND=vm cargo t` runs the same suite on the encoded VM,
as CI does on its second pass.
