# The admin app

What the host runs, and the forms that change it (issue #17): enable or
disable an app, change its grant, its fetch allowlist and its limits, reset
it to its `app.toml`, and read the change history. What each app holds and
what it said are there to read as well — a page of its `kv` store and the
last lines of its log — and only to read. Pages, form reading,
validation and rendering are Cove; everything it learns of the host and every
change it makes go through one host module, `host`, whose capability is
`admin` — and **only this app may be granted `admin`**. The startup banner
and `/_host/stats` say so like any other grant:

```text
  admin      v1-…  requires [admin, auth]  granted [admin, auth]  ok: …
```

The host side — what a change means, what is refused, where it is kept — is
in [docs/design.md, Administering apps at run time](../../docs/design.md#administering-apps-at-run-time).

| request | does |
| --- | --- |
| `GET /` | every app: state (`serving`, `disabled`, `refused`, `removed`) and why, version and tier, how it is reached, what its code requires and what it is granted (changes marked), its counters and store |
| `GET /apps/<app>` | one app in full, its limits and recent errors, and the forms below |
| `POST /apps/<app>/enable`, `/disable` | routes to the app again, or stops (503; its data stays) |
| `POST /apps/<app>/configure` | the grant (`cap.<name>` checkboxes), the allowlist (`allow`, one per line) and every limit (`maxHostCalls`, `deadlineMs`, `maxHeapWords`, `maxInFlight`, `maxQueued`, `maxRequestBytes`, `maxResponseBytes`) |
| `POST /apps/<app>/reset` | drops the changes made here, back to `app.toml` |
| `GET /apps/<app>/kv` | a page of the app's store: 50 keys at a time (`prefix` to narrow, `after` to go on), each value cut to a line; `?key=<key>` is one key, its value whole. **Reading only** — nothing here writes to another app's store |
| `GET /apps/<app>/logs` | the last lines the app logged and the host said of it, oldest first, with their level; `?n=` how many (1–1000, 200 by default). The ring is in memory, so a restart empties it |
| `GET /history` | every change, made here or by `minicloud` on the machine, refused ones included |
| `GET /secrets` | the host's secret store: each secret stored or used by an app — set or unset, when it was set, which apps use it — **never a value** |
| `POST /secrets/set` | `name` and `value` (a password field, never filled back in): stores it and reloads the apps that use it; the page says what each reload came to |
| `POST /secrets/delete` | `name`, `confirm` (a required checkbox: there is no script for a dialog), and `force` for a secret an app uses, which leaves those apps refused |

The secret store and what a change to it does are in
[docs/design.md, Secrets set at run time](../../docs/design.md#secrets-set-at-run-time).

A change that went through redirects back to the app's page (`?done=`); one
that did not answers 422 with the reasons — the form's own (a field that is
not a whole number, below its least value, an allowlist line that is not
`http(s)://…`), or the host's (the reload's) — and the form as posted.

## On a screen of any width

The pages are one stylesheet, inline in each of them ([`pages.cove`](pages.cove),
`css`), and no script at all: what they do on a phone, they do in CSS. Nothing
scrolls sideways under about 760 px — each row of a wide table (the apps, the
history, the secrets, an app's recent errors) becomes a card, its cells
labelled by the column headings they lose, and the forms' fields go one to a
line. The colours are custom properties with a `prefers-color-scheme: dark`
set beside them, and `color-scheme` tells the browser to draw its own parts —
the checkboxes, the scrollbars, the login prompt — to match.

## Getting in

- **Only by hostname**: `[route] hosts = ["covtools-admin.ramda.io",
  "admin.localhost"]`. `https://covtools.ramda.io/admin/` is a 404, so the
  main hostname's Access policy and its bypass paths are never a way in. On
  the machine, a browser reaches `http://admin.localhost:8790/` (`*.localhost`
  is loopback).
- **Cloudflare Access** in front of `covtools-admin.ramda.io`, owner only, no
  bypass ([deploy/cloudflare.md](../../deploy/cloudflare.md)).
- **Verified by the host** (issue #23): every request needs an identity,
  `auth.identity(request.headers)`. Deployed, that is the Access token the
  request came with (`Cf-Access-Jwt-Assertion`, or the `CF_Authorization`
  cookie), which the host verifies against the team's keys and the
  `covtools-admin` Access application's AUD tag — `[access]` in `app.toml`,
  its values from `ACCESS_TEAM_DOMAIN`, `COVTOOLS_ADMIN_ACCESS_AUD` and
  `ACCESS_ALLOWED_EMAILS` in the environment. Without a valid one the answer
  is 403, with no login prompt, so logging in to Access is all a browser
  does. `fallback = "none"`: `ADMIN_UI_TOKEN` is not accepted while Access
  is on, so a request straight to the host's port gets nowhere.
- **Run without Access** (`team` or `aud` unset, as locally): the secret
  `[secrets] admin = { env = "ADMIN_UI_TOKEN" }` is the way in —
  `Authorization: Bearer <token>`, or the browser's login prompt (401 with
  `WWW-Authenticate: Basic`) with the token as the password.
- **A change from another site is refused** (403): a POST whose
  `Sec-Fetch-Site` is not `same-origin`, or whose `Origin` is not the app's
  own. The host tells the app its origin is the hostname it was routed by
  (`https://covtools-admin.ramda.io` under `--public-origin
  https://covtools.ramda.io`), so the main hostname's pages cannot post here
  either.
- Every value shown is HTML-escaped; the pages carry a CSP of `default-src
  'none'` with inline styles only — **no script at all** — `form-action
  'self'`, `frame-ancestors 'none'`, and `no-store`.
- Who made a change is the verified email from the Access token (`admin
  app: you@example.com` in the history), or `token` when the secret got in.
  The unsigned `Cf-Access-Authenticated-User-Email` header is not read: any
  client can send it.

Isolation between apps in one process is a fault and resource boundary, not a
security boundary against malicious code (main README, *Security*): `admin`
is a capability to give to code you trust, which is why one app holds it.

## If it breaks

The admin app is an app like the others: if it is refused or broken, the host
and every other app run on. It cannot disable itself, take `admin` away from
itself, or make any change that would leave it refused. On the machine, the
admin listener still can — `minicloud enable|disable|reset <app>` — and the
changes are plain JSON in `<data>/_host/overrides.json`, which can be edited
or deleted before a restart.

```console
$ ADMIN_UI_TOKEN=secret ./target/checked/minicloud serve --apps apps
$ curl -s -u x:secret http://admin.localhost:8080/ | head
$ open http://admin.localhost:8080/
```
