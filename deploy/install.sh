# Installs a minicloud release (the platform: the binary and deploy/) under

#
#   install.sh [--with-bundled-apps "admin"] [--root DIR] VERSION|TARBALL
#
#   VERSION   a release tag (v0.5.0 or 0.5.0): downloaded from GitHub
#   TARBALL   a local minicloud-<version>-x86_64-linux.tar.gz, with its
#             .sha256 beside it
#
# A release before 0.5.0 (cove-host-<version>-x86_64-linux.tar.gz, binary
# `cove-host`) installs too, so going back to one is the same command. A
# release from 0.5.0 on ships `cove-host` as a symbolic link to `minicloud`,
# for the unit's `ExecStart=.../current/cove-host serve`.
#
# The apps are not the release's: they are whatever was deployed into
# <root>/apps (`minicloud deploy`, from any repository; README "Deploying an
# app"). Installing a release never removes or replaces one of them, but for
# the one app the release bundles, the admin app, which it deploys by default
# (`--with-bundled-apps ""` deploys none). The example apps (webhooks, ledger,
# algo, ...) are not in the release: deploy them from the repository's
# examples/ with `minicloud deploy` (README "Examples").
#
# What it does:
#   1. downloads (or takes) the tarball and verifies its sha256;
#   2. unpacks it into <root>/releases/<version>/;
#   3. creates <root>/env from deploy/env.example with fresh random secrets
#      if there is none (mode 0600); if there is one, appends each key of the
#      release's env.example that it lacks — a `KEY=change-me` as a fresh
#      secret, any other `KEY=value` as written there — and changes nothing
#      else in it;
#   4. checks every app installed in <root>/apps with the release's binary,
#      against that env and the secret store in <root>/data — with the
#      bundled apps named by --with-bundled-apps in place of their installed
#      versions — and stops, switching nothing, if any would be refused
#      (`--deployed`: a key an installed app.toml may no longer say is a
#      warning, as it is when the host starts, not a refusal);
#   5. deploys the bundled apps --with-bundled-apps names, from the release,
#      with `minicloud deploy --into <root>/apps` (each checked again; the
#      version it replaces is kept in <root>/apps/.previous/<app>); `admin`,
#      the only one, by default;
#   6. points <root>/current at the release; <root>/data is never touched;
#   7. keeps the three newest releases, and prints what to run with sudo.
