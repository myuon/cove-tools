# minicloud

A small self-hosted cloud for web apps written in
[Cove](https://github.com/myuon/cove), on one machine.

An app is a directory of Cove code and an `app.toml`. The host loads each app
once — checks it, prepares it, compiles it to machine code where the machine
has a native tier — and then runs **every request in a fresh isolate** on a
shared pool of worker threads. A run that waits on I/O parks and holds no
worker; a long run yields its worker at a safepoint when others are waiting;
apps are served round robin, so one busy app cannot starve the rest.

Each app gets only the **capabilities** its `app.toml` grants (logging,
timers, a persistent key-value store, outbound HTTP to an allowlist, the
clock, randomness, authentication), and runs under **limits** — a deadline,
a host-call budget, a heap, a queue — that end that app's request and nobody
else's. Apps are **deployed, updated and rolled back** on the running host:
a new version is switched to only if it loads, and requests in flight finish
on the version they started on. An **admin app** changes apps' grants and
limits at run time and keeps their secrets, and the host shows what it is
doing as **stats**, an operations page and per-app logs.

Same-process isolation is a fault and resource boundary for code you run
yourself, **not a security boundary against untrusted or malicious code**:
see [Security](#security).

The repository:

- **[`crates/minicloud`](crates/minicloud)** — the host, in Rust: the
  `minicloud` binary.
- **[`apps/admin`](apps/admin/README.md)** — the admin app, the one app a
  release bundles.
- **[`deploy/`](deploy)** — the install script, systemd unit and backups that
  run the host on a server.
- **[`examples/`](examples)** — apps deployed like any other: not part of a
  release, checked and tested by CI.
- **[`docs/`](docs)** — [design notes](docs/design.md), [what the tests
  cover](docs/testing.md) and [measurements](docs/measurements.md).

minicloud was called cove-tools, and its binary `cove-host`, until 0.5.0
([issue #43](https://github.com/myuon/minicloud/issues/43)); a server keeps
some of those names ([Names kept from cove-tools](#names-kept-from-cove-tools)).

## Quick start

```console
$ cargo build --profile checked
$ ./target/checked/minicloud serve --apps examples

listening on http://127.0.0.1:8080 — 16 worker thread(s), a run yields after 2.0 ms while others wait, a fresh isolate per request, apps served round robin
  stats: curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8080/_host/stats   ops page: http://127.0.0.1:8080/_host/ui
  admin: http://127.0.0.1:8081 (token in data/admin.token); update with `minicloud update <app>`
```

Two apps were refused because they take a secret from an environment
variable that is not set; every other app serves, and a refused one answers
503 with that reason. Set `LEDGER_TOKEN` and `WEBHOOKS_ADMIN_TOKEN` to any
value to serve them too. (`--profile checked` is release with debug
assertions and overflow checks on; `--release` works as well.)

An app is reached under `/<app>/`:

```console

```

`slow`'s answer says it parked twice (`x-cove-run-parks: 2`) and spent
0.2 ms of its 400 ms on a worker (`x-cove-run-worker-us: 204`). A bug in an app is one failed request,
answered with the runtime's diagnostic and the limit that stopped it:

```console

`GET /` lists the apps; `/_host/ui` is the operations page
([Operating](#operating)). Stop the host with Ctrl-C.

`serve` takes:

| flag | default | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--apps DIR` | `apps` | one directory per app |
| `--data DIR` | `data` | the apps' state (`<data>/<app>/`) and the host's (`<data>/_host/`, `<data>/admin.token`) |
| `--addr ADDR` | `127.0.0.1:8080` | the public listener |
| `--admin ADDR` / `--no-admin` | `127.0.0.1:8081` | the admin listener: deploys, updates, configuration; keep it on localhost |
| `--workers N` | one per hardware thread | threads that run Cove |
| `--io-threads N` | `2` | threads for HTTP and pending host work |

| `--max-connections N` | `10000` | connections open at once |
| `--max-in-flight N` | `10000` | requests admitted at once, over every app |
| `--backend auto\|vm\|native` | `auto` | the native tier where the machine has one (Unix x86-64), else the VM |
| `--ops-listener public\|admin` | `public` | which listener serves `/_host/` |
| `--public-origin URL` | — | the origin clients reach the host at, behind a TLS-terminating proxy |
| `--trust-proxy` | off | believe `X-Forwarded-Proto` and `X-Forwarded-Host` instead |
| `--shutdown-grace SECONDS` | `10` | on SIGTERM or Ctrl-C, how long to wait for requests in flight |
| `--quiet` | off | no `log` lines on stdout |

`minicloud --version` names the Cove commit the binary was built against.

## Writing an app

An app is a directory holding an `app.toml`. The `.cove` files directly in
it are the module named after the directory; each subdirectory holding
`.cove` files is a module of that name, which the app may `use`. Nothing
outside the directory is visible: every app is a package of its own with the
standard library.

The entry is `handle(request: web.Request) -> web.Response` in the main
module (`<app>.handle`, unless `entry` in `app.toml` says otherwise):

```cove
use web

export fn handle(request: web.Request) -> web.Response {
  // request.method, request.path, request.query, request.headers, request.body
  web.Response(status: 200, headers: Map.of(), body: "hello\n")
}
```

- `path` is the path below the app's prefix: `/hello/a/b` reaches `hello`
  with `/a/b`.
- `query` and `headers` are `Map<String, String>`; header names are
  lowercased, and `x-forwarded-prefix` says where the app is mounted
  (`/hello`) so it can link to itself.
- `body` is a `String`; a request body that is not UTF-8 is answered 400
  before the app runs.
- A response without a `content-type` gets `text/plain; charset=utf-8`;
  `content-length`, `transfer-encoding`, `connection`, `keep-alive` and
  `upgrade` are the HTTP layer's and are dropped.

### `app.toml`

Every key is optional, and an unknown one refuses the app, so a misspelt
limit is never silently not applied. The defaults are shown:

```toml
entry = "hello.handle"          # `<app>.handle` by default
grant = ["log", "timer"]        # the capabilities granted; none by default

[limits]
deadline = "10s"                # per request, parked time included ("ms" or "s")
max_host_calls = 1000           # per request
# max_call_depth = 512          # per request; no default but the runtime's own bound
# max_heap_words = 4194304      # per request; the runtime's default, 32 MiB
max_in_flight = 64              # this app's runs started and not answered
max_queued = 256                # this app's requests waiting to start
max_request_bytes = 1048576     # request body
max_response_bytes = 4194304    # response body

[kv]                            # the app's store, with `kv` granted
max_key_bytes = 1024
max_value_bytes = 1048576
max_keys = 100000
max_bytes = 67108864            # keys and values, summed

[fetch]                         # outbound HTTP, with `fetch` granted
allow = []                      # e.g. ["https://api.github.com", "http://127.0.0.1:*"]
timeout = "10s"                 # one fetch, connect to last byte
max_request_bytes = 1048576
max_response_bytes = 4194304    # the decoded body

# [fetch.headers."https://api.openai.com"]   # a secret the host adds as a header
# authorization = { secret = "openai", prefix = "Bearer " }

[route]
hosts = []                      # e.g. ["admin.example"]: reached by these hostnames only

[secrets]                       # what `auth.check` and `[fetch.headers]` use; one of:
# admin = { env = "APP_ADMIN_TOKEN" }  # an environment variable of the host
# admin = { store = "admin" }          # the host's secret store, set at run time
# admin = { file = "admin.secret" }    # a file, relative to the app's directory
# admin = { value = "..." }            # literal, for tests

# [access]                      # Cloudflare Access, for `auth.identity`
# team = { env = "ACCESS_TEAM_DOMAIN" }
# aud = { env = "APP_ACCESS_AUD" }
# emails = { env = "ACCESS_ALLOWED_EMAILS" }  # optional: only these users
# token = "admin"               # a `[secrets]` name: the way in without Access
# fallback = "none"             # or "token": the token as well with Access on
```

An app is refused at load — answered 503 with the reason, while every other
app serves — if its config does not read, its code does not check (warnings
included), its entry requires a capability it is not granted, its code can
`spawn` a task, or a secret it names cannot be resolved (the value is never
printed). An `[access]` value is a setting, not a secret: an unset `team` or
`aud` turns Access off for the app. The rules for `[fetch]`, `[secrets]`,
`[route]` and `[access]` are in [docs/design.md](docs/design.md).

### Host modules

| module | capability | what |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `web` | — | the `Request` and `Response` types; building a response needs no capability |
| `log` | `log` | `info`, `warn`, `error`: a line on stdout (`[app] level: line`) and in the app's log |
| `timer` | `timer` | `sleep(millis)`: parks the run, at most 60 s |
| `kv` | `kv` | the app's own SQLite store: `get`, `put`, `delete`, `increment`, `list`, `listDesc`; a `put` past a quota is the app's `Err` |
| `fetch` | `fetch` | `get(url)`, `request(method, url, headers, body)` to the `[fetch] allow` list only; parks the run; redirects are not followed |
| `time` | `time` | `nowMillis()`, `nowMicros()` |
| `random` | `random` | `hex(bytes)`: 1–64 bytes from the operating system |
| `auth` | `auth` | `check(secret, authorization)` against a `[secrets]` entry the app never reads; `identity(headers)`, the Cloudflare Access user the host verified; `usesAccess()` |
| `host` | `admin` | the admin app's view of the host and its changes; only the app named `admin` may be granted it |

The exact signatures are the schemas in the source:
[`hosts.rs`](crates/minicloud/src/hosts.rs) (`web`, `log`, `timer`),
[`kv.rs`](crates/minicloud/src/kv.rs), [`fetch.rs`](crates/minicloud/src/fetch.rs),
[`sys.rs`](crates/minicloud/src/sys.rs) (`time`, `random`, `auth`) and
[`admin_module.rs`](crates/minicloud/src/admin_module.rs) (`host`). How
`kv`, `fetch` and `auth` behave is in [docs/design.md](docs/design.md).

### Checking and testing an app

`cove check` and `cove test` do not know the host's modules, so `minicloud`
has its own. `check` runs the admission `serve` runs at load and exits
non-zero if any app would be refused:

```console
$ ./target/checked/minicloud check --apps crates/minicloud/tests/apps greedy spawner
error[minicloud::spawn]: `spawner.handle` can spawn a task, which minicloud does not run
 --> spawner/spawner.cove:6:19
  |
6 |     let doubled = tasks.spawn { 21 * 2 }
  |                   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  rule: A spawned task runs outside the host's worker pool and keeps its parent from parking or yielding; minicloud refuses an app that can spawn.
greedy     requires [log]  granted [-]  REFUSED: `greedy.handle` requires `log`, which app.toml does not grant
spawner    requires [-]  granted [-]  REFUSED: `spawner.handle` can spawn a task, which minicloud does not run
checked 2 app(s) against the host's schemas (web, log, timer, kv, fetch, time, random, auth, host); 0 warning(s), 2 refused
```

`test` runs every `test fn` the way `cove test` does, with the app's grant,
its limits and the host's modules:

```console
$ ./target/checked/minicloud test --apps examples hello crunch
ok    crunch     crunch.aSizeOutOfRangeIsRefused
ok    crunch     crunch.countsThePrimesUpToN
ok    hello      hello.answersABodyOfTheSizeAsked
ok    hello      hello.greetsTheWorldWhenNobodyIsNamed
ok    hello      hello.greetsWhoeverTheQueryNames
ran 5 test(s), 5 passed
```

Both take app names to narrow them, and `--data DIR` to look `{ store = … }`
secrets up in that data directory's store; `test` takes `--filter`. `check`
refuses an app whose secret cannot be resolved, as `serve` would; `test`
gives such a secret the value `minicloud-test-placeholder-<name>` and says so
on stderr.

## Deploying an app

The host's apps change on the running host, through its **admin listener**
(`--admin`, `127.0.0.1:8081` by default) — never the public one. Every admin
request needs the token the host writes to `<data>/admin.token` (mode 0600)
the first time it starts without one; the `minicloud` subcommands read it from
`data/admin.token` and reach `127.0.0.1:8081` unless given `--token-file`
and `--admin`.

`minicloud deploy <dir>` sends an app from anywhere — its own repository,
say — to the running host. The host loads it as the app's next version
**and only if it loads** writes it into the apps directory and switches to
it; otherwise nothing changes and the diagnostics are printed. Against a
host started with `--apps apps`, from a copy of `examples/hello` in
`src/hello` with a README beside its code:

```console
$ ./target/checked/minicloud deploy src/hello
minicloud: not part of the app, left out: README.md
minicloud: deploying `hello`: 3 file(s), 2433 bytes
{
  "app": "hello",
  "previous": null,
  "version": "v1-e421b416"
}
$ $EDITOR src/hello/hello.cove                   # Hello → Hi
$ ./target/checked/minicloud deploy src/hello 2>/dev/null | grep '"version"'
  "version": "v2-0a514f4f"
$ ./target/checked/minicloud rollback hello | grep '"version"'
  "version": "v3-e421b416"
$ echo 'fn broken( {' >> src/hello/hello.cove
$ ./target/checked/minicloud deploy src/hello; echo "exit $?"
minicloud: not part of the app, left out: README.md
minicloud: deploying `hello`: 3 file(s), 2443 bytes
minicloud: 422 Unprocessable Entity
deploy of `hello` refused; still serving v3-e421b416:
does not parse:
error[cove::parse::unexpected_token]: expected identifier, found `{`
  --> hello/hello.cove:51:12
   |
51 | fn broken( {
   |            ^

exit 1
```

- Only `app.toml` and the `.cove` files are sent; symbolic links, paths
  outside the directory, and more than 16 MiB or 4096 files are refused. The
  app's name is the directory's (`--name` for another).
- The deployed copy replaces `<apps>/<app>`; the one it replaced is kept in
  `<apps>/.previous/<app>`. `minicloud rollback <app>` swaps them back (a
  second rollback undoes the first).
- `deploy -` reads a tar archive of the app on stdin, and needs `--name`.
- `deploy <dir> --into <apps>` writes into an apps directory with no running
  host, checking as `minicloud check` does; the host loads it at its next
  start. `install.sh` installs the admin app this way.
- An app that needs a secret the host lacks is refused, saying which: set it
  first, in the host's environment or its secret store
  ([Secrets set at run time](#secrets-set-at-run-time)).

`minicloud update <app>` reloads `<apps>/<app>` as it is on disk, through the
same load-then-switch. Each version is `v<n>-<hash of the app's files>`, and
every response names the one that answered (`x-cove-app-version`). Requests
in flight — queued, running, yielded or parked — finish on the version they
were admitted to; the old version is dropped with its last request. The
app's store, log and counters carry over.

The other admin subcommands are `remove`, `enable`, `disable`, `reset` and
`secret` ([Operating](#operating)); `minicloud <command> --help` describes
each. The listener's HTTP endpoints are listed in
[docs/design.md](docs/design.md#updates-and-versions).

**To a server, over ssh.** The admin listener stays on the server's
localhost and the token never leaves it: send the archive over ssh's stdin to
the `minicloud` installed there. This is how an app in another repository
(such as [myuon/ai-daily](https://github.com/myuon/ai-daily)) or an example
is deployed:

```console
$ tar -C examples/algo -c . | ssh whisky \
    '~/cove-tools/current/minicloud deploy - --name algo --admin 127.0.0.1:8791 --token-file ~/cove-tools/data/admin.token'
$ ssh whisky '~/cove-tools/current/minicloud rollback algo --admin 127.0.0.1:8791 --token-file ~/cove-tools/data/admin.token'
```

## Deploying

[`deploy/`](deploy) runs the host as a systemd service on one Linux x86-64
machine behind a TLS-terminating proxy. It is written for the owner's server
(Ubuntu 24.04, a Cloudflare Tunnel to `https://covtools.ramda.io`, Cloudflare
Access in front), and its paths say so; adapt them for another.

| file | what |
| --- | --- |
| [`install.sh`](deploy/install.sh) | installs a release as the service's user, without sudo, and prints the one sudo command |
| [`cove-tools.service`](deploy/cove-tools.service) | the systemd unit: public listener `127.0.0.1:8790`, admin `127.0.0.1:8791`, `--ops-listener admin`, `--public-origin https://covtools.ramda.io`, two workers, resource caps and hardening |
| [`env.example`](deploy/env.example) | the env file's template: the apps' secrets and the Cloudflare Access settings |
| [`backup.sh`](deploy/backup.sh) | online SQLite backups of every app's store |
| [`cloudflare.md`](deploy/cloudflare.md) | the tunnel, the hostnames and the Access applications |

A release is a tag `v<version>`: [`release.yml`](.github/workflows/release.yml)
builds `minicloud` on Ubuntu 24.04 with the native tier and publishes
`minicloud-<version>-x86_64-linux.tar.gz` (the binary, a `cove-host` link to
it, `apps/admin`, `deploy/` and this README — not `examples/`), its
`.sha256`, and `install.sh`.

### Installing

On the server, as the user the service runs as:

```console
$ curl -fsSLO https://github.com/myuon/minicloud/releases/download/v0.5.0/install.sh
$ bash install.sh v0.5.0
```

`install.sh` downloads the release and checks its sha256, unpacks it into
`~/cove-tools/releases/<version>/`, creates `~/cove-tools/env` from
`env.example` the first time (every `change-me` a fresh random secret, mode
0600), checks every installed app with the new binary, deploys the bundled
admin app (`--with-bundled-apps ""` for none), and only then points
`~/cove-tools/current` at the release. The first time, it prints the sudo
command that installs the unit and starts `cove-tools.service`.

**A release is the platform; the apps are deployed separately.** Installing
one never removes or replaces an app other than `admin`. The apps are
whatever was deployed into `~/cove-tools/apps` ([Deploying an
app](#deploying-an-app)), and their state is in `~/cove-tools/data`, which no
release or deploy touches.

### The env file and secrets

`~/cove-tools/env` is the unit's `EnvironmentFile=`: the secrets apps take
with `{ env = … }` (`WEBHOOKS_ADMIN_TOKEN`, `LEDGER_TOKEN`, `ADMIN_UI_TOKEN`)
and the Cloudflare Access settings (`ACCESS_TEAM_DOMAIN`,
`COVTOOLS_ACCESS_AUD`, `COVTOOLS_ADMIN_ACCESS_AUD`, `ACCESS_ALLOWED_EMAILS`).
A change takes a restart. A later release that adds a key gets it appended by
`install.sh`; existing keys are left alone. A secret that should change
without a restart belongs in the host's secret store instead ([Secrets set at
run time](#secrets-set-at-run-time)).

### Backups

`deploy/backup.sh` copies every app's `kv.sqlite3` with SQLite's online
backup while the host runs, into `~/cove-tools/backups/<stamp>/`, and keeps
14 days (`KEEP_DAYS`). It needs `sqlite3`; the crontab line is in the file.
The backups are on the same disk: copy them elsewhere to survive the machine.

### Cloudflare

[deploy/cloudflare.md](deploy/cloudflare.md) sets up the tunnel to the
public listener, the admin app's own hostname (`covtools-admin.ramda.io`,
through `[route] hosts`), and the Access applications whose tokens the host
verifies ([Cloudflare Access](#cloudflare-access)). The admin listener is
never in the tunnel.

### Upgrading and rolling back the platform

```console
$ bash install.sh v<new>
$ sudo systemctl restart cove-tools
```

`install.sh` says when the unit changed and needs installing again. Before it
switches, it checks every installed app with the new binary against the env
file and the secret store; if one would be refused, it stops and switches
nothing. On SIGTERM the host answers new requests 503 and waits up to
`--shutdown-grace` for those in flight.

To go back, run `install.sh` with the older version (releases before 0.5.0,
named `cove-host-<version>`, install too), or point `current` at a kept
release — the three newest are kept:

```console
$ ln -sfn releases/<old> ~/cove-tools/current && sudo systemctl restart cove-tools
```

### Names kept from cove-tools

The rename to minicloud (0.5.0) renamed the repository, the crate, the
binary and the release asset. What an installed server depends on kept its
name, so upgrading from cove-tools is `install.sh` and a restart:

- the release tarball's **`cove-host`** is a symbolic link to `minicloud`,
  because the unit runs `ExecStart=…/current/cove-host serve`;
- the unit **`cove-tools.service`**, the server root **`~/cove-tools`**
  (`releases/`, `current`, `apps/`, `data/`, `env`, `backups/`) and the
  hostnames `covtools.ramda.io` and `covtools-admin.ramda.io`; renaming them
  needs sudo and a Cloudflare change, and is later work;
- the environment variables **`COVE_TOOLS_ROOT`** and **`COVE_TOOLS_BACKUPS`**
  (`install.sh` and `backup.sh` accept `MINICLOUD_ROOT` and
  `MINICLOUD_BACKUPS` as well) and **`COVE_HOST_TEST_BACKEND`** for the
  tests.

## Operating

### The admin app

[`apps/admin`](apps/admin/README.md) is the browser's way to run the host:
every app's state, version, grant, limits, counters and recent errors;
enable and disable; change an app's grant, fetch allowlist and limits; the
change history; and the secret store. It also reads what an app holds and
what it said — a page of its `kv` store, one key at a time, and the last
lines of its log — which it can only read: the host gives it no way to
write to another app's store. It is reached only by its own
hostnames (`[route] hosts`): on the server `https://covtools-admin.ramda.io`
behind Cloudflare Access, and locally `http://admin.localhost:8080/` with
`ADMIN_UI_TOKEN` as the password:

```console
$ ADMIN_UI_TOKEN=dev ./target/checked/minicloud serve --apps apps
```

### Administering apps at run time

An app's configuration — enabled, its grant, its fetch allowlist, its limits
— can be changed on the running host by the admin app (through the `host`
module, capability `admin`, which only the app named `admin` may hold) or on
the machine through the admin listener:

```console
$ ./target/checked/minicloud disable hello
`hello` disabled: not routed to; in-flight requests finish
$ ./target/checked/minicloud enable hello
`hello` enabled: routed to again
$ ./target/checked/minicloud reset hello        # drop the admin app's changes
```

A change reloads the app with the change applied and switches to it only if
it loads — except that taking away a capability the app needs is kept, and
leaves that app refused. A disabled app answers 503 and keeps its data. The
admin app cannot disable itself or take `admin` away from itself; the admin
listener can. Changes are kept in `<data>/_host/overrides.json`, relative to
`app.toml`, and every change, refused ones included, in
`<data>/_host/changes.jsonl`. The rules are in
[docs/design.md](docs/design.md#administering-apps-at-run-time).

### Secrets set at run time

A secret an app takes with `{ store = "<name>" }` lives in the host's secret
store, `<data>/_host/secrets` (mode 0600), and is set, replaced and deleted on
the running host — from the admin app's Secrets page or with `minicloud
secret list|set|delete`. Setting one reloads every app that uses it.
Nothing returns a value: listings show names, whether each is set, when, and
which apps use it. Details:
[docs/design.md](docs/design.md#secrets-set-at-run-time).

```console
$ ssh -t whisky '~/cove-tools/current/minicloud secret set gemini --admin 127.0.0.1:8791 --token-file ~/cove-tools/data/admin.token'
value for secret `gemini` (not echoed):
```

### Cloudflare Access

An app behind Cloudflare Access calls `auth.identity(request.headers)` to
learn its user. The host verifies the Access token (`Cf-Access-Jwt-Assertion`)
itself against the team's keys and the app's `[access] aud`, so a request
that reached the host's port without going through Access has no identity.
With Access off (`team` or `aud` unset, as in a local run) the `[access]
token` secret is the way in. See
[docs/design.md](docs/design.md#cloudflare-access-who-is-asking) and
[deploy/cloudflare.md](deploy/cloudflare.md).

### The operations views

| path | what |
| --- | --- |
| `GET /_host/ui` | one HTML page, refreshed every 5 s: every app's version, state, tier, counters, queues, errors, KV usage and fetch counts, and its recent errors and log lines |
| `GET /_host/stats` | every app's counters as JSON, with the server's totals |
| `GET /_host/apps/<app>` | one app as JSON: its limits, every version it has had, its last 50 errors, and on the native tier which functions stayed on the VM and why |
| `GET /_host/apps/<app>/logs?n=200` | its recent log lines, as text |

They are read-only and unauthenticated, on the public listener by default.
With `--ops-listener admin` (as deployed) the public listener answers 404
under `/_host/` and the views are on the admin listener, to a loopback `Host`
only; reach them with `ssh -L 8791:127.0.0.1:8791 <server>` and
`http://localhost:8791/_host/ui`. The admin listener also answers `GET /apps`
(the stats) and `GET /changes?n=50` (the change history), with the token.

Per app, `/_host/stats` has `state` (`ready`, `refused`, `disabled` or
`removed`), `version`, `tier`, `required` and `granted`, `served`, `ok`,
`errors` by kind, `rejected` by reason, `in_flight`, `queued`, `parked`,
`parks`, `yields`, `yields_declined`, `overdue_yields`,
`blocking_host_calls`, `instructions`, `worker_ms`, `heap_peak_words`,
`fetch`, `kv` usage against its quota, `updates` and `versions_alive`; the
full list is in [`ops.rs`](crates/minicloud/src/ops.rs).

### Response headers

Every answer from a run carries what it cost:

| header | |
| --- | --- |
| `x-cove-app-version` | the version that answered, `v<n>-<hash>` |
| `x-cove-run-instructions` | the runtime's instruction count (compiled code dispatches none, so it undercounts on the native tier) |
| `x-cove-run-worker-us` | time on a worker, every slice summed |
| `x-cove-run-wall-us` | admission to answer |
| `x-cove-run-parks`, `x-cove-run-yields`, `x-cove-run-yields-declined` | how often the run parked, yielded, and declined to yield |
| `x-cove-stop` | on a run a limit stopped: the error kind, below |

### Limits and what they answer

| condition | status | `x-cove-stop` / counter |
| --- | --- | --- |
| no app by that name | 404 | |
| the app was refused at load | 503 with the reason | |
| the app is disabled | 503 | `rejected.disabled` |
| request body over `max_request_bytes` | 413 | `rejected.too_large` |
| request body not UTF-8 | 400 | `rejected.bad_request` |
| the app already has `max_queued` requests waiting | **429**, `Retry-After: 1` | `rejected.queue_full` |
| the server has `--max-in-flight` requests admitted | **503**, `Retry-After: 1` | `rejected.server_busy` |
| `--max-connections` open | 503, `Retry-After: 1`, connection closed | |
| waited in the queue longer than the deadline | 503, `Retry-After: 1` | `queue_timeout` |
| deadline passed, running or parked | 504 | `deadline` |
| too many host calls / calls nested too deep | 500 | `host_calls` / `call_depth` |
| the heap needs more than `max_heap_words` | 500 | `heap` |
| a `spawn` past the task limit (the backstop for a refused `spawn`) | 500 | `concurrency` |
| any other runtime error | 500 | `runtime` |
| response over `max_response_bytes`, or not a valid response | 500 | `response_too_large` / `bad_response` |
| the client went away | the run is cancelled; 499 in the app's log | `cancelled` |
| a `kv.put` past a quota, a `fetch` off the allowlist | not a status: the app's `Err` | `fetch.refused` |

429 is one app at its own limit — its neighbours are unaffected; 503 with
`Retry-After` is the whole host. A run's 500 or 504 body is the runtime's
diagnostic, with the source line.

### Logs

An app's `log` lines and the host's lines about it (a failed request, an
update, a run that would not yield) are kept in memory (the last 1,000, at
`/_host/apps/<app>/logs`) and written to `<data>/<app>/log.txt`, rotated to
`log.1.txt` past 1 MiB. Without `--quiet`, `log` lines also go to stdout; the
host's own messages go to stderr — on the server, `journalctl -u cove-tools`.
The admin app shows the same ring, a line at a time with its level
(`/apps/<app>/logs`), so the lines are there in a browser as well.

## Security

Same-process isolation between apps is a fault and resource boundary for
code you run yourself: each request is its own isolate with its own heap and
budget, an app can reach only the host modules it is granted, and one app's
bug, overload or budget overrun ends that app's requests and nobody else's.
**It is not a security guarantee against untrusted or malicious code**: the
apps share one process, one address space and one native code generator, and
nothing here has been reviewed as a sandbox. Deploy only apps you wrote or
reviewed; `admin` is a capability for code you trust.

There is no TLS. Put the host behind a reverse proxy (Caddy, nginx,
cloudflared) that terminates it and forwards to `--addr`, which defaults to
localhost, and pass `--public-origin` so the apps' same-origin checks and
the URLs they write use the public origin. Keep the admin listener on
localhost.

## Examples

[`examples/`](examples) holds apps written for minicloud. They are not in a
release: each is deployed with `minicloud deploy` like an app from any other
repository ([Deploying an app](#deploying-an-app)). They live here rather
than in Cove's repository because they are checked against minicloud's host
modules, and CI checks and tests them.

| app | grant | what |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [`hello`](examples/hello) | — | greets `?name=`; `/echo`, `/big?bytes=`, and `/spin`, which runs into its deadline |
| [`crunch`](examples/crunch) | — | counts primes up to `?n=`: CPU-heavy, the reason for the slice |
| [`slow`](examples/slow) | `log`, `timer` | sleeps `?ms=` `?times=`: a run that parks |
| [`notes`](examples/notes) | `kv`, `log` | a note per path, in the app's own store |
| [`proxy`](examples/proxy) | `fetch`, `log` | forwards a request to `?url=` on its allowlist |
| [`webhooks`](examples/webhooks/README.md) | `kv`, `fetch`, `auth`, … | the webhook lab: receive URLs that keep every request, and pages to read and resend them |
| [`ledger`](examples/ledger/README.md) | `kv`, `auth`, `log` | the bench ledger: benchmark results posted as JSON, and pages to compare them |
| [`algo`](examples/algo/README.md) | `time` | the algorithm playground: bipartite matching, SAT and simulated annealing, run on request |

`webhooks` and `ledger` take a secret from the environment
(`WEBHOOKS_ADMIN_TOKEN`, `LEDGER_TOKEN`); on the server those are in
`~/cove-tools/env`. Deploy one from a checkout over ssh, as in [Deploying an
app](#deploying-an-app):

```console
$ tar -C examples/ledger -c . | ssh whisky \
    '~/cove-tools/current/minicloud deploy - --name ledger --admin 127.0.0.1:8791 --token-file ~/cove-tools/data/admin.token'
```

## Development

The host is Rust; the apps are Cove. Cove is a git dependency pinned to one
commit (`rev` in the workspace [`Cargo.toml`](Cargo.toml)): a change the
compiler or the runtime needs goes to [myuon/cove](https://github.com/myuon/cove)
first and is picked up here by moving `rev`.

Build and test under `--profile checked` — release with debug assertions and
overflow checks on. The tests run Cove programs, which unoptimised is several
times slower; `cargo t` is an alias for `cargo test --workspace --profile
checked`. What the tests cover is in [docs/testing.md](docs/testing.md).

CI ([`ci.yml`](.github/workflows/ci.yml)) runs, on x86-64 Linux so that the
native tier is exercised:

```console
$ cargo fmt --all --check
$ cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets --profile checked -- -D warnings
$ RUSTDOCFLAGS="-D warnings" cargo doc --workspace --no-deps --profile checked
$ cargo test --workspace --profile checked
$ COVE_HOST_TEST_BACKEND=vm cargo test --profile checked --tests
$ export WEBHOOKS_ADMIN_TOKEN=ci LEDGER_TOKEN=ci ADMIN_UI_TOKEN=ci
$ ./target/checked/minicloud check --apps apps && ./target/checked/minicloud test --apps apps
$ ./target/checked/minicloud check --apps examples && ./target/checked/minicloud test --apps examples
$ sh bench/repro/run.sh native
$ shellcheck deploy/*.sh
```

and then packages the release tarball from that binary
([`deploy/package.sh`](deploy/package.sh)) and installs and runs it as
deployed ([`deploy/smoke.sh`](deploy/smoke.sh); Linux, ports 8790 and 8791).

[`bench/`](bench/README.md) is the load test (`bench/perf.sh`, with its own
load generator, `minicloud-load`) and its results;
[docs/measurements.md](docs/measurements.md) summarises them.

## Migrating from fuel (Cove ADR 0091)

Cove's [ADR 0091](https://github.com/myuon/cove/blob/main/docs/adr/0091-a-run-is-stopped-by-its-host-not-a-fuel-allowance.md)
removed the fuel allowance from the runtime, and minicloud 0.4.0 followed: a
request is bounded by its `deadline` (10 s by default), its host calls and
its heap. There is no `limits.fuel`, no `fuel` error kind or `x-cove-stop:
fuel`, no `fuel` in the stats, and no `x-cove-run-fuel` header.

- **`app.toml`**: delete `fuel` from `[limits]`, and set a `deadline` if the
  app relied on fuel to stop runaway work sooner. `minicloud check`, `test`,
  `deploy` and `update` refuse a file that still says `fuel`, by name.
- **Apps already deployed** keep running: at start (and on a rollback, an
  admin change or a secret reload) the key is ignored with a warning naming
  the app, and `install.sh` checks with `minicloud check --deployed`, which
  warns rather than refuses.
- **Admin overrides** in `<data>/_host/overrides.json` that set `fuel` lose
  it when the host reads the file, with a warning; nothing needs editing.
- **Scripts and dashboards** that read `x-cove-run-fuel` or `errors.fuel`
  should read `x-cove-run-worker-us`, `x-cove-run-instructions` or
  `worker_ms`, and expect `x-cove-stop: deadline` (504) where they expected
  `fuel` (500).

Upgrade the host first, then redeploy each app without `fuel`.
