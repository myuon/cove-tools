//! Loading an app: read its config, check it once, check its authority,
//! prepare it once, compile it once.
//!
//! Every app is compiled as a package of its own — its modules and the
//! standard library — so an app cannot `use` another app's code, and what the
//! checker derives about its entry is about its code alone. What is paid here
//! is paid once per app: parsing, checking, lowering, `PreparedProgram::new`'s
//! encoding and verification, and on the native tier the code generator. A
//! request pays for an `OwnedVm` and nothing above it.
//!
//! An app is refused — and every other app still starts — when its config
//! does not read, it does not check (warnings included), its entry requires a
//! capability `app.toml` does not grant, or its code can `spawn` a task.
