//! Changing a running app's configuration: what the admin app does through
//! the `host` module ([`crate::admin_module`]), and what `cove-host
//! enable`/`disable`/`reset` do through the admin listener.
//!
//! **A change is a re-check, never a revocation.** Cove's capabilities are
//! decided before a program runs — the checker derives what the entry
//! requires and the host refuses what is not granted — so there is no taking
//! a capability away from a run in progress. A change to an app's grant,
//! allowlist or limits loads the app again with the change applied, exactly
//! as `cove-host update` loads a new version (parse, check, admit, lower,
//! prepare, compile, off the request path), and routes to that version:
//! requests already admitted finish on the version they were admitted to.
//!
//! What comes of it:
//!
//! | the reload | the change | the app |
//! | --- | --- | --- |
//! | loads | kept, written to `overrides.json` | serves the new version |
//! | does not admit: its entry requires a capability the change took away | kept | **refused**, answering 503 with the reason; every other app serves |
//! | anything else — a limit out of range, an allowlist entry or capability that does not parse, an unknown capability, `admin` for an app that is not `admin`, a check that fails | **not kept** | serves as before; the reasons are the answer |
//!
//! Taking a capability away from an app that needs it is a decision the
//! admin may make — that is how an app is stopped from using something — so
//! it is applied; a change that is merely wrong is refused. The admin app is
//! the exception to the first row: a change that would leave *it* refused,
//! or without `admin`, is refused, as is disabling it — through the admin app.
//! The admin listener (`cove-host disable admin`, `cove-host reset admin`)
//! can still do either: it is the emergency exit, and it does not depend on
//! the admin app working.
//!
//! **Disabling** stops routing to the app and nothing else: it keeps its
//! version loaded, its queue, counters, log and store. New requests are
//! answered 503 (`app … is disabled by the administrator`, counted as
//! `rejected.disabled`); those already admitted finish. Enabling routes to it
//! again, with its data as it was.
//!
//! **Secrets** ([`crate::secrets`]) are changed here too. Setting one
//! writes the store first and then reloads every app whose `app.toml` takes
//! a secret from it (`{ store = "<name>" }`), as an update would: an app
//! that loads is routed to with the new value and requests in flight finish
//! on the old; one that does not keeps serving what it served, and the
//! answer says so — the value stays stored either way. Deleting one that an
//! app uses is refused unless forced; forced, the apps are reloaded without
//! it and installed refused, so the value is no longer used anywhere. The
//! history records the secret's name and the action, never the value.
