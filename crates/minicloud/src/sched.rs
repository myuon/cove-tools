//!
//! **Cove never runs on the async runtime.** The HTTP side admits a request
//! into its app's queue and awaits a oneshot; a worker — a plain thread —
//! takes it, builds a fresh `OwnedVm` over the app's shared
//! `PreparedProgram`, and runs it until it answers, parks or yields.
//!
//! **A parked run holds no thread.** A host that answers pending hands over a
//! [`PendingWork`] future; it is spawned on the I/O runtime, raced against the
//! run's deadline (`ParkedVm::time_left`, ADR 0082), and its answer — or the
//! deadline — puts a resume job on the app's queue, for whichever worker is
//! free. A run whose deadline came first is cancelled (`ParkedVm::cancel`) and
//! answered 504, and its future is dropped, which withdraws the work.
//!
//! **A long run is sliced.** Each worker publishes the run it is running; the
//! monitor raises a run's `YieldRequest` once it has held its worker for a
//! slice (2 ms by default) *and* something else is waiting for a worker
//! (ADR 0084, inside compiled code too by ADR 0085). The yielded run goes to
//! the back of its app's queue.
//!
//! **Apps are served round robin.** Each app has its own queue — runs to
//! resume or continue, and requests waiting to start — and a worker takes one
//! job from the next app in turn that has work it may run. A job is at most
//! one slice of a run while others wait, so an app with a thousand requests
//! queued gets one turn in N like every other busy app: its depth costs
//! itself, not its neighbours. An app at its `max_in_flight` has its starts
//! held back (its runs still continue), and an app at `max_queued` has new
//! requests rejected with 429; the server as a whole rejects with 503 past
//! `--max-in-flight`.
//!
//! **A run that cannot yield is surfaced, not trusted.** A run below an
//! encoded callee of compiled code, inside a host call, or beside a task
//! declines a yield request. The monitor counts a run still holding its
//! worker well after it was asked (`overdue_yields`) and logs it; the
//! runtime's own `yields_declined` is summed per app; the run's deadline
//! still ends it.
